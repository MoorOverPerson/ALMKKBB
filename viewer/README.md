# Interactive Whitepaper Viewer

This folder contains a simple HTML page for reading the Arabic whitepaper.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a modern web browser. It provides:

- A search box to highlight matching terms in the text.
- Buttons to search or clear the highlights.

No build step is required; the page runs purely in the browser.
